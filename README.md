# Full-stack Bookstore

## Description

This project serves as a full-stack bookstore application, providing hands-on practice for both backend and frontend development. It utilizes MongoDB to store data and employs Express for the backend. On the frontend, React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS are used to create a responsive and visually appealing user interface. The main features of the application include displaying books and supporting operations such as adding, editing, and deleting books. Additionally, users can choose between a table and card view to visualize the book data.

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies for this project, run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
npm install
```

## Usage

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory and run the backend server using the following command: using the terminal:
   ```sh
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```



2. Simultaneously, open a new terminal window, navigate to the `frontend` directory, and run the React application:
   ```sh
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

This will start both the backend and frontend servers, allowing you to access and interact with the full-stack bookstore application.
